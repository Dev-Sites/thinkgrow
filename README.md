this is Earl Nightingale the purpose of

this recording is to tell you about and

try to condense one of the most amazing

books ever written Think and Grow Rich

by Napoleon Hill without question this

single book has had a greater influence

on the lives accomplishments and

fortunes of more individuals than any

other work of its kind all over the free

world there are literally thousands of

successful men and all lines of work

well where they are today because they

once picked up and bought a copy of

Think and Grow Rich and they'll be quick

to tell you so I first discovered this

remarkable book in the fall of 1949 it

was an enormous help to me it helped me

decide once and for all how I was to

accomplish my goal it unified my

thinking and gave me a straight clear

Road to the point I had decided to reach

one of my closest friends found the book

several years ago and stayed home for

three days reading and digesting its

material and he then went on to reached

the top in his industry i sat in richly

paneled competent executive offices and

listened to world famous business

leaders some of them old enough to be my

father tell me that everything worked

out fine after they had read Think and

Grow Rich now what's the secret of this

amazing book why has this book out of

all the thousands of self-help books

remain the one towering giant I think to

understand this you have to know

Napoleon Hill as I do

he certainly was not the first man to be

appalled at the poverty and seemingly

endless struggle and lack of direction

he saw about him as a boy and as a young

man nor was he the first to write on the

subject but he possessed two unique

highly developed abilities seldom found

in one man the first was in the manner

in which he approached his subject

Napoleon Hill went after the answers to

achievement in the same way a scientist

seeks to open to the light of Reason a

secret of nature he went after the

solution to accomplishment in the same

way Thomas Edison discovered the

solution to the electric light

relentlessly indefatigably implacably

until the truth which had been there all

the time

was revealed to him

his second important ability was the

knack or skill of writing about his

findings in such a way that it was

instantly understood intellectually but

what is perhaps even more important for

this particular subject understood

emotionally as well on the last page of

think and Grow Rich was read the hand

which put the book down on the table was

a different hand the man who then stood

and walked out into the world was a

different changed man the suffocating

and tangling webs of self-imposed

frustration and interaction had fallen

away and now the way was clear the man

was now the possessor of the unique

unseen talent for turning dreams into

reality thoughts into things so-called

fate of the idle effects of exterior

circumstances were no longer in command

he who had been a passenger was now

suddenly the captain to begin we have to

understand the simple truth the

principle or philosophy which lies as

the supporting structure of this work

unless whatever it is you build is based

on truth you will end with the entire

structure fallen and scattered about you

like the armor of Homer's ancient

warriors it simply cannot stand it

cannot withstand the test of time the

reason thinking Grow Rich has withstood

the test of time is because it rests on

the broad clean foundation upon which

may also be found every accomplishment

of man the clear unchallengeable fact

that everything begins with an idea a

philosophy based on the fact that riches

of every kind begin with the State of

Mind that one may start with nothing but

thoughts ideas and organized plans

thoughts are sings incredibly powerful

things when mixed with definiteness of

purpose persistence and a burning desire

for their translation into material

objects or riches riches being whatever

it is you happen to want wise men have

been saying this for centuries and just

recently Charles a ceramic the truth is

that the human mind is as real an

organism as any muscle in the body but

far greater in potential power and like

muscle fiber it can be strengthened to

lead on to

conquests so this then is the truth on

which Think and Grow Rich is based if

you know what you want and if you want

it strongly enough to muster the kind of

persistence that simply cannot be

stopped

you will most certainly achieve it by

controlling your mind you can control

your destiny here on earth with this is

our foundation let's talk about napoleon

hill's famous 13 proven steps to riches

as found in his book Think and Grow Rich

remembering of course that riches are

whatever it is you happen to want and

right here let me make two important

points the first is that whenever you

listen to this record have a notebook

handy and make notes as we call on the

second is that this record was produced

for your own personal use to go with you

on your own exciting journey to play

this record for a group will prove to be

of only temporary help make sure you

have your own personal copy to play

again and again particularly at those

times when you may feel yourself getting

off the track and now napoleon hill's

famous 13 principles you will notice

that we have separated each principle by

bending them on the record in this way

you're given quick access to any

particular principle to which you may

wish to return for reference

[Music]

the first principle desire here is the

starting point for all achievement the

first step toward riches but it's right

here that we so often run into a

stumbling block a person will say I know

what I desire but can I get it

we'll get into this business of doubt

later but once and for all let's clear

up this point this point of whether or

not you can accomplish that which you

desire with all your heart I think it

was best expressed by Emerson who wrote

there is nothing capricious in nature

and the implanting of a desire indicates

that its gratification is in the

constitution of the creature that feels

it in other words you would not have the

desire unless you were capable of its

achievement each of us has a built-in

governor and our desires are modified by

our abilities and leanings whatever it

is that you desire with all your heart

understand once and for all that it can

and should be yours in Think and Grow

Rich Napoleon Hill cites example after

example of why your burning desire is

nothing more than an accurate picture of

what you will one day become so right

here firmly establish in your mind that

which you desire more than anything else

far as Helvetia spirit by annihilating

the desires you annihilate the mind

every man without passions has within in

no principle of action nor motive to act

a good way to determine whether or not

you really have a burning desire is to

examine the way you go after it if you

go after that which you think you desire

tentatively timidly in an attempt to

play it safe you don't have a burning

desire at all you can't get the second

base if you keep one foot on first but

if you're willing to burn your bridges

behind you and say once and for all this

is it this is what I will do and I will

never retreat I'll never go back then

you have the sort of desire that can

only end in success it takes that kind

of resolve to be able to keep picking

yourself up after there falls you're

bound to take

the only people who don't make mistakes

are those who never try anything the

timid feeders in the lagoon who never

venture into the broad deep sea beyond

well these principles will work for

anything you may want a more harmonious

home life a more successful career for

our example let's say your desire

happens to be more money to better care

for your family and provide for your

future years to get your share of the

prosperity that lies ahead Napoleon Hill

gives us six definite practical steps to

follow one six in your mind the exact

amount of money you desire it is not

sufficient merely to say I want plenty

of money be definite as to the amount

there's a psychological reason for

definiteness which will be described in

a subsequent principle number to

determine exactly what you intend to

give in return for the money your desire

there's no such reality as something for

nothing

three establish a definite date when you

intend to possess the money you desire

and four create a definite plan for

carrying out your desire and begin at

once whether you're ready or not

to put this plan into action 5 write out

a clear concise statement of the amount

of money you intend to acquire name the

time limit for its acquisition state

what you intend to give and return for

the money and describe clearly the plan

through which you intend to accumulate

it 6 read your written statement aloud

twice daily once just before retiring at

night and once after a rising in the

morning as you read see and feel and

believe yourself already in possession

of the money or whatever your goal

happens to be it's important that you

follow these instructions to the letter

play this part of the record over until

you have it down to your satisfaction

for this is by far the most important of

the 13 principles and this chapter of

the book ends with these words

through some strange and powerful

principle of mental chemistry which she

has never divulged nature wraps up in

the impulse of strong desire that's

something which recognizes no such word

is impossible and accepts no such

reality as failure the second principle

is faith you never would have even

thought of your main desire unless faith

were tugging at your mind and if you

find it difficult at times to have faith

in yourself you can be certain that you

can have faith in these principles

Napoleon Hill writes faith is a state of

mind which may be induced or created by

affirmation or repeated instructions to

the subconscious mind through the

principle of conscious Auto suggestion

conscious Auto suggestion simply means a

suggestion by yourself to yourself just

as an autobiography is a biography

written by the person it's about by

getting a mental image of yourself

already having accomplished your main

desire over and over again you will

muster the faith you need faith is vital

to accomplishment the emperor napoleon

once said all the scholastic scaffolding

falls as a ruined edifice before one

single word faith Pascal said faith

affirms many things respecting which the

senses are silent but nothing which they

deny it is superior to their testimony

but never opposed to it Goethe said

epochs of faith are epics of

fruitfulness but epochs of unbelief

however glittering a barren of all

permanent good and a Schlegel put it in

actual life every great Enterprise

begins with and takes its first forward

step in faith have faith that you can

accomplish that which you seek for you

would never have decided upon it unless

it was meant for you to accomplish in

his chapter on faith Napoleon Hill gives

us a self-confidence formula first I

know that I have the ability to achieve

the object of my definite purpose in

life therefore I demand of myself

persistent continuous action toward its

attainment and I here and now promised

to render such action

second I realized that dominant thoughts

of my mind will eventually reproduce

themselves in outward physical action

and gradually transform themselves into

physical reality therefore I will

concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes

daily upon the task of thinking of the

person I intend to become thereby

creating in my mind a clear mental

picture of that person third I know

through the principle of Auto suggestion

any desire that I persistently hold in

my mind will eventually seek expression

through some practical means of

attaining the object back of it

therefore I will devote ten minutes

daily to demanding of myself the

development of self confidence fourth I

have clearly written down a description

of my definite chief aim in life and I

will never stop trying until I have

developed sufficient self confidence for

its attainment fifth I fully realized

that no wealth or position can long

endure

unless built upon truth and justice

therefore I will engage in no

transaction which does not benefit all

whom it affects I will succeed by

attracting to myself the forces I wish

to use and the cooperation of other

people I will induce others to serve me

because of my willingness to serve

others I will eliminate hatred envy

jealousy selfishness and cynicism by

developing love for all humanity because

I know that a negative attitude toward

others can never bring me success

I will cause others to believe in me

because I will believe in them and in

myself in rereading thinking Grow Rich

so that I could write this condensation

for recording I was forcibly struck all

over again by this great chapter on

faith particularly the examples of how

some of the world's greatest men have

accomplished what appeared to be

impossible through faith

the third principle is Auto suggestion

and we've already touched on this this

chapter the book tells us how through

repeated suggestion the subconscious

mind can be put to work for us it is the

Faculty of being able to concentrate

your mind on your burning desire until

your subconscious mind accepts it as

fact and begins to devise ways of

bringing it about here is where hunches

come from sudden flashes of thought or

inspiration guidance the instructions

given in connection with the six steps

in the second chapter will now be

summarized and blended with the

principles covered by a napoleon hill's

chapter on auto suggestion first go into

some quiet spot perhaps in bed at night

close your eyes and repeat aloud so you

may hear your own words the written

statement of the amount of money you

intend to accumulate or a careful

reaffirmation of whatever your goal

happens to be the time limit for its

accumulation and a description of the

service or merchandise you intend to

give in return for the money as you

carry out these instructions see

yourself already in possession of your

goal for example suppose that you intend

to accumulate fifty thousand dollars by

the 1st of January five years from now

that you intend to give personal

services and return for the money in the

capacity of a Salesman your written

statement of your purpose should be

similar to the following by the first

day of January 19 whatever it happens to

be I will have in my possession fifty

thousand dollars which will come to me

in various amounts from time to time

during the interim in return for this

money I will give the most efficient

service of which I'm capable rendering

the fullest possible quantity and the

best possible quality of service in the

capacity of salesmen of and here

described the product or service you

intend to sell or whatever it is you do

for a living

it goes on I believe that I will have

this money in my possession my faith is

so strong that I can now see this money

before my eyes I can touch it with my

hands it is now awaiting transfer to me

at the time and in the proportion that I

deliver the service I intend to render

in return for it I am awaiting a plan by

which to accumulate this money and I

will follow that plan when it is

received

second repeat this program night and

morning until you can see in your

imagination the money you intend to

accumulate third place a written copy of

your statement where you can see at

night and morning and read it just

before retiring and upon arising until

it's been memorized as you carry out

these instructions you are applying the

principle of auto suggestion the fourth

principle is specialized knowledge it is

here that I think Napoleon Hill makes a

very important point

knowledge is power only to the extent

that it is organized into a definite

plan of action and directed to a

definite end to quote from the book

before you can be sure of your ability

to transmute desire into its monetary

equivalent you will require specialized

knowledge of the service merchandise or

profession

which you intend to offer in return for

fortune perhaps you may need much more

specialized knowledge than you have the

ability or the information require and

if this should be true you may bridge

your weakness through the aid of your

mastermind group more on this later but

for now realize that you must learn all

you can about your specialty set aside a

definite time every day for learning

more about what it is you do for a

living take the courses that are offered

on your subject and associate with men

who know your business well

[Music]

the fifth principle is imagination the

imagination is literally the workshop

where in our fashion doll plans created

by man the impulse the desire is given

shape form and action through the aid of

the imaginative Faculty of the mind it

has been said that man can create

anything he can imagine as Napoleon Hill

says and teaches whatever the mind of

man can conceive and believe it can

achieve man's only limitation within

reason lies in his development and use

of his imagination and subsequent

motivation to action the great leaders

of business industry finance and the

great artists musicians poets and

writers became great because they

developed the power of self motivation

incidentally one of the best books ever

put together on this subject if not the

greatest is success through positive

mental attitude by Napoleon Hill and W

Clement stone I suggest you get a copy

from your bookstore at your earliest

convenience if your bookstore happens to

be out of the book you may obtain a copy

by writing to the address on the label

of this record as you go about your

daily work think constantly of ways in

which it could be done better more

efficiently think of the changes that

are inevitable can they be made now and

if you feel limited remember the words

of the late Frank Lloyd Wright

he said the human race built most nobly

when limitations were greatest and

therefore when most was required of

imagination in order to build it all

limitations seemed to have always been

the best friends of architecture as you

build your future from this point onward

don't concern yourself with limitations

but remember that they may be your best

friends since they require imagination

if were to rise above them and this

Beecher said the soul without

imagination is what an observatory would

be without a telescope now if you turn

this record over we'll get to the sixth

principle

[Music]

the sixth principle is organized

planning you have decided on your desire

your goal now let's organize the plan

for its accomplishment right on schedule

let me quote again from Think and Grow

Rich you have learned that everything

man creates or acquires begins in the

form of desire the desire is taken on

the first lap of its journey from the

abstract to the concrete in the workshop

of the imagination for plans for its

transition are created and organized

earlier you were instructed to take six

definite practical steps as your first

move in translating the desire for

whatever you want into its physical

equivalent one of these steps is the

formation of a definite practical plan

or plans through which this

transformation may be made one Li

yourself with one or more persons a

group of as many people as you may need

for the creation and carrying out of

your plan or plans for the accumulation

of the money you've established as your

goal making use of the mastermind

principle this is important too before

forming your mastermind alliance decide

what advantages and benefits you may

offer the individual members of your

group in return for their cooperation

no one will work indefinitely without

some form of compensation although this

may not always be in the form of money

three arrange to meet with the members

of your mastermind group at least twice

a week and more often if possible until

you have jointly perfected the necessary

plan or plans for the accomplishment of

your goal four maintain perfect harmony

between yourself and every member of

your mastermind group keep in mind these

facts first you're engaged in an

undertaking of major importance to you

to be sure of success you must have

plans which are faultless second you

must have the advantage of the

experience education native ability and

imagination of other minds this is in

harmony with the methods followed by

every person who has risen above the

average work at this until you have a

well-executed formal plan for reaching

your objective in this way you're never

confused or wondering what you should do

every morning you know exactly what

you're going to do and why it is in this

chapter of thinking Grow Rich that

Napoleon Hill gives us his eleven

qualities of leadership one unwavering

courage to self control three a keen

sense of justice for definiteness of

decision five definiteness of plans six

the habit of doing more than paid for

seven a pleasing personality eight

sympathy and understanding nine mastery

of detail ten willingness to assume full

responsibility and eleven cooperation

the chapter on organized planning is one

of the largest and most important in the

book it goes without saying that a man

without a plan to follow is like a ship

without a course no place to go with

disaster a probability

[Music]

the seventh principle decision the

mastery of procrastination to quote

accurate analysis of over twenty five

thousand men and women who had

experienced failure disclosed the fact

that lack of decision was near the head

of the last of the thirty major causes

of failure this is no mayor's statement

of a theory in his effect

procrastination the opposite of decision

is a common enemy which every man must

conquer analysis of several hundred

people who had accumulated fortunes well

beyond the million dollar mark disclosed

the fact that every one of them had the

habit of reaching decisions promptly and

of changing these decisions slowly if

and when they were changed people who

fail to accumulate money without

exception have the habit of reaching

decisions if at all very slowly and of

changing these decisions quickly and

often a definite objective makes

reaching prompt decisions that much

easier Napoleon Hill gives many examples

one of which is the case of Henry Ford

one of Henry Ford's most outstanding

qualities was his habit of reaching

decisions quickly and definitely and

changing them slowly this quality was so

pronounced to the late mr. Ford that it

earned the reputation of being obstinate

it was this quality which prompted mr.

Ford to continue to manufacture his

famous Model T the world's ugliest but

for the time most practical car when all

of his advisers and many of the

purchases of the car were urging him to

change it perhaps he delayed too long in

making the change but the other side of

the story is that his firmness of

decision yielded a huge fortune before

the change in model became necessary and

the company's certainly none the worse

for today when you make up your mind

stay with it the majority of people who

fail to make the grade and generally

easily influenced by the opinions of

others easily swayed they permit the

newspapers and the gossiping neighbors

to do their thinking for them opinions

are the cheapest commodities on earth

keep your own counsel when you begin to

put into practice the principles we're

describing here by reaching your own

decisions and following them take no one

into your confidence except the members

of your mastermind group and be very

careful in your selection of this group

that you choose only those who will be

in complete sympathy and harmony with

your purpose

close friends and relatives while not

meaning to do so often handicapped one

through opinions and sometimes through

ridicule thousands of men and women

carry inferiority complexes with them

all through life because some

well-meaning but ignorant person

destroyed their confidence through

opinions or ridicule if a decision is

worth anything at all it's worth

sticking to until it's been completely

worked the eighth principle persistence

Napoleon Hill defines persistence as the

power of will willpower and desire when

properly combined make an irresistible

pair persistence to an individual is

what carbon is to steel in uncounted

thousands of cases persistence has stood

as the difference between success and

failure it is this quality more than any

other that keeps the majority from great

accomplishment they will try a thing but

as soon as the going gets tough they

fold experience with thousands of people

has proved that lack of persistence is a

weakness common to the majority of men

it is a weakness which may be overcome

by effort if you are to accomplish the

desire you've set for yourself you must

form the habit of persistence things

will get dark it will seem as though

there's no longer any reason to continue

everything in you will tell you to give

up to quit trying and it's right here

that the men are separated from the boys

it's right here that if you'll go that

extra mile and keep going that the skies

will clear and you'll begin to see the

first signs of the abundance that is to

be yours because you had the courage to

persist with persistence will come

success persistence is a state of mind

therefore it can be cultivated like all

states of mind persistence is based upon

definite causes among them these 1

definiteness of purpose knowing what you

want to desire 3 self-reliance 4

definiteness of plans 5 accurate

knowledge knowing that your plan is

sound 6 cooperation sympathy

understanding and harmonious cooperation

with others tend to develop resistance 7

willpower 8 habit persistence is the

direct result of habit

the ninth principle power of the

mastermind it is in this section that

Napoleon Hill describes the importance

of forming a group of individuals

sympathetic to your desire they may be

individuals with similar plans a

mastermind group can be made up of two

or more individuals no two Minds ever

come together without thereby creating a

third a third invisible intangible force

which may be likened to a third mind you

may have noticed many times that by

discussing something with another

individual you suddenly get good ideas

as a result of this Association ideas

you would not have gotten without this

Association the same thing happens to

the other person

a lot of good ideas have been born in

individual minds as a result of having

met in committee associating with your

mastermind group is not meant as a means

of letting others do your thinking for

you far from it it is to stimulate your

own thinking through the association

with other minds no one knows everything

the more sympathetic Minds you get

together and by sympathetic I mean

working for a common purpose the more

related information is going to be

available and great ideas are a

combination of related information so

pick the member or members of your

mastermind group with care make sure

there are people you respect and who are

hardworking and conscientious you have a

lot of fun and you'll all reach your

goals just that much similar the tenth

principle could be called enthusiasm

that is the enthusiasm that comes from

the channeling of all bodily drives into

positive worthwhile outlets it is in

this chapter that Napoleon a describes

the importance of the woman the one and

only woman in the achievement of a

worthwhile goal it seemed quite

significant to mr. Hill that practically

every great leader was a man whose

achievements were largely inspired by a

woman when things get tough and you can

count on if they will you may be

deserted by what you thought were

friends but if you've got a good woman

you'll never be alone she'll be willing

to start over again if necessary and

she'll give you the new enthusiasm that

comes through her faith in you having

someone to love is having someone to

share your success and accomplishment

to give you the praise that all of us

need from time to time a man can become

successful without a wife and family but

all the real joy is taken out of it take

care of your wife and children as your

greatest possessions the 11th principle

has to do with the subconscious mind the

subconscious mind consists of a field of

consciousness in which every impulse of

thought that reaches the objective mind

through any of the five senses is

classified and recorded and from which

thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as

letters may be taken from a filing

cabinet if your sieves and files sense

impressions or thoughts regardless of

their nature you may voluntarily plant

in your subconscious mind any plan

thought or purpose which you desire to

translate into its physical or monetary

equivalent the subconscious acts first

on the dominating desires which have

been mixed with emotional feeling such

as faith your subconscious mind works

night and day through a method of

procedure unknown to man the

subconscious mind draws upon the forces

of infinite intelligence for the power

with which it voluntarily transmutes

one's desires into their physical

equivalent making use always of the most

practical media by which this end may be

accomplished

you cannot entirely control your

subconscious mind but you can

voluntarily hand over to it any plan

desire or purpose which you wish

transformed in a concrete form

no one knows very much about what we

call the subconscious or unconscious

mind we do know that it is incalculably

powerful and can solve our problems if

we go about using it the right way and

the best way is to hold in your

conscious mind as often as possible a

clearer picture of yourself already

having accomplished your goal you know

what you want define it clearly and then

project it on the motion picture screen

of your mind

hold it see yourself doing the things

and having the things you'll have when

your objective will have been reached do

this as often as possible as you go

about your daily work and particularly

at night just before you go to sleep and

the first thing upon arising

as you do this your subconscious will

begin to lead you in the most logical

ways toward your objective don't fight

it

follow your sudden hunches the ideas

that come into your mind knowing that

it's your subconscious trying to get

through to your conscious mind if you

keep at this you'll be amazed and

delighted by the wonderful ideas that

just seem to come from nowhere in the

next principle we'll talk some more

about this sixth sense that seems to

control the lives of the great men and

women but it comes from a systemic

triggering of the subconscious mind the

lives of the great men and women which

seem miraculous to the average person

are nothing more than the fulfillment of

their burning desires through the power

of their subconscious minds time means

nothing to your subconscious a man could

work steadily at his job for 40 years

and not accomplish as much as is

possible

in three or four years through the

proper working of this principle your

subconscious mind cannot remain idle if

you fail to plant desires in your

subconscious mind it will feed upon the

thoughts which reach it as a result of

your neglect remember that you're living

daily in the midst of all manner of

thought impulses which are reaching your

subconscious mind without your knowledge

some of these impulses are negative some

are positive you are now engaged in

trying to help shut off the flow of

negative impulses and to aid in

voluntarily influencing your

subconscious mind through positive

impulses of desire when you achieve this

you will possess the key which unlocks

the door to your subconscious mind

Bulova wrote the man who succeeds above

his fellows is the one who early in life

clearly discerns his object and toward

that object habitually directs his

powers even genius itself is but fine

observation strengthened by fixity of

purpose

every man who observes vigilantly and

resolves steadfastly grows unconsciously

into genius the key word there is

unconsciously know what you want decide

once and for all that it will be yours

remain steadfast on course propelled by

faith and your subconscious or

unconscious mind will do the rest

the twelfth principle as outlined in

thinking Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill has

to do with the brain if you had access

to all the wealth in the world and took

a penny you would be doing exactly what

you very probably have been doing in the

use of your brain nothing in the world

is more pitiful than the

misunderstanding by the average person

of the power of his brain and the minds

to which it is connected the conscious

and the subconscious you own in your

brain the most marvelous miraculous

inconceivably powerful force the world

has ever known

take for example the fact that the

number of lines which connect the brain

cells with one another equal a figure

one followed by 15 million ciphers it

has been determined that there are from

ten to fourteen billion cells and the

average human cerebral cortex it is

inconceivable that such a network of

intricate machinery should be in

existence for the sole purpose of

carrying on the physical functions

incidental to growth and maintenance of

the physical body this is the mechanism

that has given us these supersonic

airplane are deep rocket probes into

outer space the sciences the arts all

that we know and use today and will use

tomorrow have hatched from this small

gray mass each of us carries around do

you can you doubt even for a moment that

it can bring you and yours everything

you want here on earth of course it can

if you will recognize your power as an

individual and stop acting like those

who have never even thought about it

give it the job you've decided to

accomplish and watch it handle it the

thirteenth and final principle is called

the sixth sense the sixth sense can be

described as the sense through which

infinite intelligence may and will

communicate voluntarily without any

effort from or demands by the individual

this principle is the apex of the

philosophy it can be assimilated

understood and applied only by first

mastering the other twelve principles

the sixth sense is that portion of the

subconscious mind which has been

referred to as the creative imagination

it has also been referred to as the

receiving

set through which ideas plans and

thoughts flash into the mind the flashes

are sometimes called punches or

inspirations the sixth sense defies

description it cannot be described to a

person who has not mastered the other

principles of this philosophy because

such a person has no knowledge and no

experience with which the sixth sense

may be compared the sixth sense is not

something that one can take off and put

on at will ability to use this great

power comes slowly through application

of the other principles we've outlined

many individuals come into a workable

knowledge of the sixth sense even before

the age of 40 but more often the

knowledge is not available until one is

well past fifty and this for the reason

that the spiritual forces with which the

sixth sense is so closely related do not

mature and become usable generally

except through years of meditation

self-examination and serious thought but

begin to develop it now by applying the

principles we've talked about here

remember this man can create nothing

which he does not first conceived in the

form of an impulse of thought mens

thought impulses begin immediately to

translate themselves and their physical

equivalent whether those thoughts are

voluntary or involuntary keep fear out

of your mind by concentrating on the

mental picture of your goal your

greatest desire now I want to mention

that Think and Grow Rich as a book

carries more endorsements by great men

who knew of its truth than any other

book of its kind ever written I'll touch

on only a few all of these great men

actually endorsed napoleon hill's

principles former President of the

United States William Howard Taft FW

Woolworth wrote that he had built his

great chain of stores by applying many

of these principles

Robert dollar who built the great dollar

steamship line wrote if I had had this

philosophy 50 years ago I suppose I

could have accomplished all that I've

done in less than half the time I

sincerely hope the world will discover

and reward you Samuel Gompers wrote that

the mastery of these principles is the

equivalent of an insurance policy

against failure President Woodrow Wilson

John Wanamaker the merchant prince wrote

I know that your fundamentals are sound

because I've been applying them in my

business for more than 30 years George

Eastman the world

largest maker of cameras Thomas Edison

Luther Burbank Theodore Roosevelt iam

Statler john d rockefeller i think you

great men could not have been bought
